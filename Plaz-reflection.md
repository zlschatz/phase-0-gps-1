What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with the concepts of branching, pulling and merging mostly.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The concepts clarified during the GPS were merging conflicts, what’s base branch and compare branch refer to. Also, what the fetch command did and why it was important to always have a new branch before starting a challenge.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked about pushing, fetching and pulling from repositories, considering these my weakest points.

What still confuses you about git?

After this session I think everything we have learned up to now I understand. I’m still confused about the way to go back into past stages and undo changes.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Great thought it was a great opportunity to ask questions and meet my future cohort members.
