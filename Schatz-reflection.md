#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to the session, I was less comfortable fluently using commands and navigating the command line. It seemed foreign to me but Luis assisted through navigation to help me practice. Before the session I was also struggling with the concept of pull requests. Since we had only completed a pull request on our own in the week-1 module, I did not fully understand its purpose.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GPS helped clarify a couple of concepts. As mentioned above - I had struggled with the pull request challenge during week-1. During the GPS, I was able to talk out the process and understand that pull requests are meant as double checks within a team. One member makes a request, the other checks over the work and approves the changes being made. Similarly, the concept of merging branches was reiterated during the session.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I relied on my pair, Luis, for a few refreshers on commands. He was very sharp with the week-1 commands, so whenever I was unsure, he was able to properly navigate through a challenge. Lorena - the guide - was also very helpful in deeper explanation of the code execution. We asked about pushing and fetching. These were concepts that neither Luis nor myself had encountered before.

#What still confuses you about git?
Not sure if it falls under confusion -- but I tend to be nervous when merging after a commit. I don't believe I have had the experience of jumping back to a previous commit to make any changes yet.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It went well! I can understand how working with another person will be very helpful while learning to code. Pushing each other to solidify concepts helps everyone in the end.
